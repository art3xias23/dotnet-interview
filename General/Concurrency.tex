\chapter{Optimistic vs Pessimistic Concurrency}

\section{Optimistic}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple Transactions or users are allowed to access a resource
	\item It's assumed \textbf{conflicts will rarely occur}
	\item Conflicts are only checked \textbf{during the commit stage}
	\item During a conflict the system checks if the data has been modified by another process 
	and if it has a conflict exception is thrown and \textbf{the user needs to retry or resolve the conflict}
\end{itemize}

\section{Pessimistic}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It's assumed \textbf{conflicts will likely occur}
	\item When a resource is accessed a lock is placed on it
	
		\begin{lstlisting}[style=Sql]
-- Lock the row with an update lock to prevent other transactions from modifying it
SELECT *
FROM employees WITH (UPDLOCK)
WHERE employee_id = 123;

-- Perform the update on the locked row
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.05
WHERE employee_id = 123;

-- Commit the transaction to release the lock
COMMIT;
		\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
